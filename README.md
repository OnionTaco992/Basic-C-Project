# Basic-C-Project
Just something I've been working on to improve my C skills, as I'm still learning it. Also using this to test out Git.

Currently it just serves as some math related thing (it has functions for things like fibonnacci and factorial sequence generation, temperature conversion tools, and gcd/lcm functions).

I'll probably add non math related things into it, but that's for when I actually get to that.

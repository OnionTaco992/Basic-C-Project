# OT TOOLS
Main branch. Gets updated when I do something relatively important, and when the program is actually stable (or at least seems to be stable).

All this is is just a way for me to learn C.

## Download(s)

You can download the program here: https://github.com/OnionTaco992/Basic-C-Project/releases

## Extras

Later on this may get a linux port, however that probably wont be for a bit. I'll need to get a pc first, although once I do get a pc, this will get a linux build.
Wont have a mac build though. I have no reason to make one.
